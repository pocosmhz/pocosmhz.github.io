I always liked to interact with people through public forums like those on [NNTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol).

So, I found this very useful [list](http://www.freeusenetnews.com/) of publicly accessible NNTP servers.

I'm giving a try to `news.mixmin.net` and it seems that can do the trick for me.

However, for a better service, I strongly recommend sites like [Giganews](http://www.giganews.com) (also in the list).
