One of my hobbies kept me busy this afternoon. I'm trying to fix a diskette drive of a [Philips NMS8245](https://www.msx.org/wiki/Philips_NMS_8245), from 1987.

At first, in absence of the typical noise of a magnetic head moving in and out, I thought that either the drive was broken, or at least the rubber belt was dry or broken.

I found [this site](https://hansotten.file-hunter.com/do-it-yourself/msx-floppy-drives/) where they tell that the reference for the belt, should you need one, is . Also, in this other [document](https://hansotten.file-hunter.com/uploads/files/Drive%20repareren%208245.pdf) (in Dutch) you can see how to replace it.

> (belt is 48mmX3mm,  
> Part N° DFWV75C0009  
> Part Name: Round Belt, Rubbor, 3mm  
> Item N° S01-4-Y2000 (FW-U1P501J)  
> MatsuhitaElectric)  
> The belt in the Phips VG8235 and NMS8245 is the type label BF60 in dutch electronic shops.

For the time being, the motor is working, and the belt is not broken. I think it's a bit loose and thus, it has not enough grip. I've already done a search in eBay and found [this](https://www.ebay.es/itm/311802984809?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&amp;fromMakeTrack=true), and the same item in this [shop](https://console5.com/store/msx-floppy-drive-belt-3-5.html). Both a bit afar.

Beside the disk drive issue, the computer and the monochrome monitor are in full working condition after all these years. I'll keep you posted.
