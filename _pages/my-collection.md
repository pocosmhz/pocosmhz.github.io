Here you can find information about my retro collection.

# Computers

## Sinclair Spectrum +2

This was my first personal computer. Neverending summers playing computer games with it.
Also a lot of learning, as it came under the terms of taking a computer course. 

## Philips NMS 8245

I managed to buy this one, together with its monochrome monitor, thanks to a MSX computer club.

## Commodore Amiga 500

This was adquired on eBay and I'm planning on retrobrighting it soon.

## Commodore Amiga 1200

I have two of these, both coming from a batch of [NOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_old_stock).
One of them I bought it from [AmigaKit](https://amigakit.amiga.store) and the other one directly from [Petro Tyschtschenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petro_Tyschtschenko). Great guy.

In one of them I have a Phase 5's [Blizzard 1230IV](http://amiga.resource.cx/exp/blizzard1230mk4) accelerator card. I managed to put 32 MBytes of RAM there.

Sadly, no SCSI daughter board, I'm afraid.

## iMac G3

I've had several of these. Currently I have a iMac G3 Graphite, with 1 GB RAM and wi-fi.

## PowerMac G4

From that time I was working for a certain ISP, at a certain point one of these was about to be throuwn away "because it's broken".

I took it home. Changed one DIMM module and *voil√†*.

# Consoles

## Sega Master System

I bought this one brand new, but almost at the end of life of the product.

## Game Boy Pocket

I bought this one as a past-time, with few games, in order to have something to play with during long haul bus trips and such.

## Neo Geo Pocket

A curiosity adquired on eBay.

## XBox

It is the first generation of this Microsoft console. I bought it on 2003 and a work colleague mod-chipped it for me.

## Sony PS One

A former work colleague was eager to get rid of it for very few money, rather than throwing it away. So, I have it.
